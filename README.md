# asl-recognizer


The overall goal of this project is to build a word recognizer for American Sign Language video sequences, demonstrating the power of probabalistic models. In particular, this project employs hidden Markov models (HMM's) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research 


Recognizers like these are very important
